Perfect. I’ll now give you **clean, detailed, copy-paste-ready prompts for EACH MODULE**, written exactly to match **your clarified project logic**, with **no fluff and no ambiguity**.

I’ll first restate the project **once**, then give **module prompts** that *logically enforce it*.
This is the level judges and senior devs expect.

# 🔁 Final Locked Project Definition (Authoritative)

> Any person can lend money.
> Any person can borrow money by locking collateral.
>
> Unlike Aave, liquidation does **not** happen immediately when price drops.
> A **belief window** is granted to the borrower to recover.
>
> Interest dynamically adjusts based on ETH price movement:
>
> * ETH price increases → interest decreases
> * ETH price decreases slightly → interest increases slightly
> * ETH price decreases drastically → interest increases drastically
>
> However, **if the borrower is detected as becoming bankrupt**, liquidation occurs immediately to protect the lender.

This is **Belief-Based Lending (BBL)** on Sui.

# 🧩 MODULE-BY-MODULE DETAILED PROMPTS

Each prompt is **self-contained**.
You can use each one to:

* implement a `.move` file
* explain architecture
* justify design to judges

## 📦 MODULE 1 — `loan_core.move`

### (Loan Creation & Asset Ownership)

### 🔹 Purpose

Create and store a loan as a **first-class on-chain object**.

### 🔹 Detailed Prompt

> Implement a Sui Move module that defines a `LoanObject` representing a single lending agreement.
>
> Each `LoanObject` must:
>
> * represent exactly one loan
> * store borrower and lender addresses
> * lock borrower collateral on-chain
> * track borrowed amount
> * track loan status (`Healthy`, `Belief`, `Liquidated`)
> * store current interest tier
> * store belief window expiry timestamp
>
> Implement a `create_loan` function where:
>
> * the lender provides loan funds
> * the borrower provides collateral
> * lender funds are transferred to the borrower immediately
> * collateral is locked inside the `LoanObject`
> * the loan starts in `Healthy` state
>
> The module must not:
>
> * perform liquidation
> * calculate interest
> * evaluate health
>
> Ensure:
>
> * one loan = one object
> * no global lending pools
> * ownership and roles are explicit

## 📦 MODULE 2 — `price_oracle_mock.move`

### (ETH Price Simulation for Hackathon)

### 🔹 Purpose

Provide ETH price data for interest and risk logic.

### 🔹 Detailed Prompt

> Implement a mock ETH price feed module for demonstration purposes.
>
> The module must:
>
> * store a simulated ETH price
> * allow controlled updates (increase, mild decrease, severe decrease)
> * expose a function to read the current ETH price
>
> This module must:
>
> * NOT rely on real oracles
> * be clearly marked as demo-only
> * act as the single source of price truth for the protocol

---

## 📦 MODULE 3 — `interest_model.move`

### (Dynamic Interest Based on ETH Movement)

### 🔹 Purpose

Adjust lender compensation based on market stress.

### 🔹 Detailed Prompt

> Implement a tier-based interest model that adjusts interest according to ETH price movement.
>
> The module must:
>
> * compare current ETH price to a previous reference price
> * classify market movement into tiers
>
> Interest rules:
>
> * ETH price increases → interest decreases
> * ETH price decreases slightly → interest increases slightly
> * ETH price decreases significantly → interest increases significantly
>
> Implement:
>
> * an `InterestTier` enum or integer scale
> * a function that assigns the correct interest tier
>
> The module must:
>
> * only assign interest tiers
> * not perform real interest math
> * store interest tier in the `LoanObject`

---

## 📦 MODULE 4 — `health_engine.move`

### (Solvency & Bankruptcy Detection)

### 🔹 Purpose

Detect when a borrower is at risk or bankrupt.

### 🔹 Detailed Prompt

> Implement a loan health evaluation module that determines whether a loan is:
>
> * healthy
> * unsafe (eligible for belief window)
> * bankrupt (must be liquidated immediately)
>
> The module must:
>
> * calculate collateral value using ETH price
> * compare it to borrowed amount
>
> Define two thresholds:
>
> * **unsafe threshold** → triggers belief window
> * **bankruptcy threshold** → triggers immediate liquidation
>
> Implement functions:
>
> * `is_unsafe()`
> * `is_bankrupt()`
>
> This module must:
>
> * NOT perform liquidation
> * only signal risk states

---

## 📦 MODULE 5 — `belief_window.move` ⭐ (CORE MODULE)

### (Delayed Liquidation Logic)

### 🔹 Purpose

Prevent panic liquidations and enforce belief.

### 🔹 Detailed Prompt

> Implement a belief window mechanism for loans detected as unsafe but not bankrupt.
>
> When a loan becomes unsafe:
>
> * it must enter `Belief` state
> * liquidation must be temporarily blocked
> * a belief window timer must start
>
> The module must:
>
> * store belief window expiry timestamp
> * allow belief window to end early if health improves
> * prevent liquidation during active belief
>
> Implement:
>
> * `enter_belief_window()`
> * `is_belief_active()`
>
> Ensure:
>
> * belief window is per-loan
> * belief does NOT apply to bankrupt loans

---

## 📦 MODULE 6 — `recovery_actions.move`

### (Borrower Recovery During Belief)

### 🔹 Purpose

Allow borrower to save their position.

### 🔹 Detailed Prompt

> Implement borrower recovery functions usable only during an active belief window.
>
> The borrower must be able to:
>
> * add more collateral
> * repay part of the debt
>
> The module must:
>
> * re-evaluate loan health after recovery
> * immediately exit belief state if loan becomes healthy
>
> Ensure:
>
> * only the borrower can call recovery functions
> * recovery is rejected if belief window expired

---

## 📦 MODULE 7 — `liquidation.move`

### (Final Protection for Lender)

### 🔹 Purpose

Protect lenders from loss.

### 🔹 Detailed Prompt

> Implement liquidation logic with **two paths**:
>
> **Immediate liquidation**
>
> * if loan is detected as bankrupt
>
> **Delayed liquidation**
>
> * if belief window expired
> * and loan remains unsafe
>
> On liquidation:
>
> * mark loan as `Liquidated`
> * transfer collateral to lender
>
> The module must:
>
> * strictly prevent liquidation during active belief
> * allow immediate liquidation only for bankruptcy cases

---

## 📦 MODULE 8 — `demo_controller.move` / frontend

### (Judge Experience Layer)

### 🔹 Purpose

Make the logic visible.

### 🔹 Detailed Prompt

> Implement a demo controller or frontend that:
>
> * opens a loan
> * simulates ETH price changes
> * shows interest tier changes
> * displays belief countdown
> * allows recovery or liquidation
>
> The demo must clearly show:
>
> * belief delaying liquidation
> * bankruptcy overriding belief
> * interest reacting to price movement

# 🧠 One-Sentence Judge Explanation (Memorize)

> “Anti-Gravity replaces instant liquidation with belief windows and volatility-based interest, while still enforcing immediate liquidation when bankruptcy risk threatens lenders.”

## ✅ Final Confirmation

* ✔ Your idea is **coherent**
* ✔ The modules now **fully enforce your logic**
* ✔ This is **not just Aave with delays**
* ✔ Judges can clearly see **why Sui matters**
