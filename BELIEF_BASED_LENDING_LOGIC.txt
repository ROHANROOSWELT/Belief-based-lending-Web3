BELIEF-BASED LENDING LOGIC

1. Economic Zones

   A. Healthy Zone (≥ 120%)
      - Condition: `collateral_value >= 1.2 * debt`
      - Interest: Normal (Base Tier)
      - Liquidation: BLOCKED

   B. Unsafe (Belief) Zone (100% - 120%)
      - Condition: `1.0 * debt <= collateral_value < 1.2 * debt`
      - Status: Unsafe / Belief Active
      - Interest: Increases (Paying for time / Risk Premium)
      - Liquidation: BLOCKED (Even if Belief Window expires, as long as Solvent)

   C. Bankruptcy Zone (< 100%)
      - Condition: `collateral_value < 1.0 * debt`
      - Status: Bankrupt / Insolvent
      - Belief Window: IGNORED
      - Recovery: BLOCKED
      - Liquidation: IMMEDIATE

2. Liquidation Logic
   
   Liquidation occurs ONLY when:
   `collateral_value < principal + accrued_interest`
   (i.e., when the loan is strictly insolvent / Bankrupt).

   Panic liquidations during temporary drops (where asset value still covers debt) are permanently prevented by the Unsafe Zone buffer.
